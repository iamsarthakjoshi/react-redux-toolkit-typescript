# react-redux-toolkit-typescript
A simple react To-Do App using React Tool Kit (RKT) and Typescript.


![App Peekaboo!](https://github.com/iamsarthakjoshi/react-redux-toolkit-typescript/blob/master/app-image.png?raw=true)


The `master` or `redux-toolkit-way` branches demonstrates the React Tool Kit usages, replacing the old way,

whereas `redux-original-old-way` branch demonstrates the traditional way of using Redux.

## How to start app?
- Clone the repository and `cd` to the folder
- Install dependencies `npm i`
- Start application: `npm start`

## Want to checkout the old way of doing Redux? :(
- First fetch the `redux-original-old-way` and checkout into the branch: 
    - Run `git fetch origin redux-original-old-way` and `git checkouredux-original-old-way`
- Sadly you have to install the dependencies again, so run: `npm i`
- Start application: `npm start`
